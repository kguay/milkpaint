Milk paint, a milk-based paint made with natural pigments, looks great not only on furniture and shaker boxes, but also on websites. This color pallet offers numerous combinations of colors and shades.

Colors are taken from <a href="http://www.milkpaint.com" target="_blank">www.milkpaint.com</a>, where Milk Paint can be purchased.

The CSS is built the same way as <a href="http://materializecss.com/color.html" target="_blank">MaterializeCSS</a> (a Google Material Design style). In order to use lighter shades of the base colors (e.g. Marigold mixed with 90% Snow White), use multiple classes (e.g. marigold and white-90).

Example:
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="milkpaint-min.css">
  </head>
  <body class="marigold white-90">
    <h1 class="barn-red-text">Milk Paint CSS</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
