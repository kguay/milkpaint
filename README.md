Colors are taken from http://www.milkpaint.com/, where Milk Paint can be purchased.

In order to use lighter shades of the base colors (e.g. Marigold mixed with 90% Snow White), use multiple classes (e.g. marigold and white-90).

Example:
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="milkpaint-min.css">
  </head>
  <body class="marigold white-90">
    <h1 class="barn-red-text">Milk Paint CSS</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
