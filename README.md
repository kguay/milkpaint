# Milkpaint CSS

Colors are taken from http://www.milkpaint.com/, where Milk Paint can be purchased.

In order to use lighter shades of the base colors (e.g. Marigold Yellow mixed with 90% Snow White), use multiple classes (e.g. marigold-yellow and white-90)

Example:
```
<html>
  <head>
	  <link rel="stylesheet" href="milkpaint-min.css">
	</head>
	<body class="marigold-yellow white-90">
		<h1 class="barn-red">Milk Paint CSS</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```
